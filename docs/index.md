# BabyHuBERT

BabyHuBERT is an audio encoder model trained by reconstructing multilingual child-centered long-form audio recordings. From the raw audios, the model extracts richer representations from long-form recordings than usual models trained on clean, well spelled speech. You don't usually use a model as is, you fine-tune the pretrained model to a specific task.


## What BabyHuBERT is *not*

- **Not the voice type classifier** — it extracts from raw audios representations that can be used for voice type segmentation. To extract voice type segments refer to [VTC2.0](../index.md).

## What BabyHuBERT *is*

!!! tip "tdlr"
    HuBERT model trained over 40 languages on 13 000 hours of speech from child-centered long-form audio recordings
